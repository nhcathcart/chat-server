# Chat Server

This is a basic chat server and client very loosely based on the IRC protocol. I made it to learn about socket programming. It registers users with a NICK(nickname) and a PASS(password). Users then can LOGIN to the server using their NICK and PASS in another session. It supports channels, private messaging, who is online, get channel members, and broadcast. It uses REDIS as a data store to persist nicknames, passwords, and channel subscribers.
