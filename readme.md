# Chat Server

This is a basic chat server and client very loosely based on the IRC protocol. I made it to learn about socket programming. It registers users with a NICK and USER. It supports channels, private messaging, and broadcast. In the future I would like to implement some kind of data store, so that NICKs and USERs can persist in between logins.
